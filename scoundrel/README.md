# Scoundrel Solitaire Game Engine

A Clojure implementation of the Scoundrel solitaire dungeon-crawler card game.

## Game Overview

Scoundrel is a single-player card game where you navigate through a dungeon fighting monsters, collecting weapons, and using potions to survive.

**Objective**: Play through all 44 cards without your health reaching zero.

## Rules Summary

### Deck Composition
- 44 cards total (standard 52-card deck minus red face cards and red aces)
- Includes: All clubs/spades, black diamonds/hearts, red number cards (2-10)

### Card Types
- **Monsters** (Clubs/Spades): Deal damage equal to their value unless defeated with a weapon
- **Weapons** (Diamonds): Equip to defeat monsters; must attack progressively weaker monsters
- **Potions** (Hearts): Heal for their value; only the first potion per turn heals

### Gameplay
1. Start with 20 health
2. Deal 4 cards face-up to create a room
3. Choose 3 cards to play in your preferred order
4. Apply card effects:
   - Monsters: Take damage OR defeat with weapon (if valid)
   - Weapons: Equip (replaces previous weapon)
   - Potions: Heal (first per turn only)
5. Remaining card stays for next room, deal 3 new cards
6. Repeat until all cards played (win) or health reaches 0 (lose)

### Special Rules
- **Weapon Constraint**: Each monster defeated must have a lower value than the previous one
- **Potion Constraint**: Only the first potion played per turn heals
- **Room Skip**: Place all 4 room cards at bottom of deck and deal fresh room (cannot skip consecutively)
- **Turn Definition**: Playing all 3 cards from one room = one turn

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
cd scoundrel
clojure -M:test
```

### Playing Interactively (Human Player)

```bash
cd scoundrel

# Play an interactive game as the human player
clojure -M:play
```

This launches an interactive CLI game where YOU make all the decisions! The game will:
- Display your current health, weapon, and room cards
- Prompt you to choose which card to leave behind
- Ask you for the order to play the remaining 3 cards
- Show visual feedback for each card played
- Display final statistics when the game ends

### Running Simulations

```bash
cd scoundrel

# Run 5000 games with random player (default)
clojure -M:sim

# Run 10000 games with greedy player
clojure -M:sim -p :greedy -g 10000

# Run 10000 games with smart player
clojure -M:sim -p :smart -g 10000

# Run with debug mode (shows detailed info for failed/lost games)
clojure -M:sim -p smart -g 10 -d

# Run 1000 games with custom turn limit
clojure -M:sim -g 1000 -t 150

# Show help
clojure -M:sim -h
```

### REPL Development

```bash
cd scoundrel
clojure -M:repl
```

                 (recur (conj acc result))
                 acc)))
(def stats (sim/aggregate-results results))

## Game State Schema

```clojure
{:deck []                    ; Remaining undealt cards
 :room #{}                   ; Current 4 cards (set - unordered)
 :health 20                  ; Current health
 :equipped-weapon nil        ; {:card ... :defeated-monsters [...]}
 :skipped-last-room? false   ; Consecutive skip prevention
 :turn-potions-used 0        ; Potions used this turn
 :turn 0                     ; Current turn number
 :transactions []            ; Transaction log (full game history)
 :status :playing}           ; :playing, :won, :lost
```

## Transaction Logging

All game actions are recorded in the `:transactions` vector for analysis and debugging. Each transaction is a map with `:type` and `:turn` plus action-specific data:

- `:card-played` - Records each card play with card type
- `:damage-taken` - Monster damage with health before/after
- `:monster-defeated` - Weapon defeating monster
- `:weapon-equipped` - Equipping weapons (tracks replacements)
- `:healed` - Potion healing with amount and health after
- `:potion-wasted` - Non-first potions with reason
- `:room-skipped` - Room skip with skipped cards
- `:room-completed` - Room completion marker
- `:game-ended` - Final outcome with health

Transaction logs enable:
- Game replay and analysis
- Strategy evaluation
- Debugging game logic
- Win/loss pattern identification

## Design Decisions

1. **Room as Set**: Makes card selection natural (choose subset of 4)
2. **Defeated Monsters Stack**: Full history for debugging, easy peek for constraint checking
3. **Turn Boundary**: 3 cards from one room = 1 turn (potion counter resets after)
4. **Immutable State**: All functions return new state (functional programming pattern)
5. **No Discard Pile**: Not needed for core mechanics; can be derived from game state
6. **Player Protocol**: Multimethod dispatch on `:type` key for extensible AI strategies
7. **Greedy Heuristics**: Simple card sorting based on game state (health, weapon equipped)
8. **Safety Limits**: Max turn count prevents infinite loops in game simulation
9. **Transaction Logging**: Comprehensive action history following Monopoly engine pattern
10. **Turn Tracking**: Turn counter increments at start of each room for consistent logging

## Player Types

The game supports multiple player types with different decision-making strategies:

### Human (`:human`)
- **Interactive CLI player** - YOU make all the decisions!
- Use `clojure -M:play` to play interactively
- Features:
  - Visual display of game state (health, weapon, deck)
  - Prompts for which card to leave behind
  - Input validation for card order
  - Real-time feedback on card effects
  - Final game statistics

### Random (`:random`)
- Baseline AI for comparison
- Randomly chooses card to leave
- Plays remaining cards in random order
- Never skips rooms
- **Win rate: ~1-2%**

### Greedy (`:greedy`)
- Simple heuristic-based AI
- Prioritizes immediate survival
- Basic card sorting by type
- Skips dangerous rooms when health is low
- **Win rate: ~3-5%**

### Smart (`:smart`)
- Advanced strategic AI with lookahead simulation
- Evaluates all possible plays and chooses optimal strategy
- Features:
  - Weapon preservation for difficult monsters
  - Potion efficiency (minimizes wasted healing)
  - Strategic room skipping (dangerous rooms or potion waste)
  - Optimal card ordering
- **Win rate: ~15-25%**
